Windows Netbeans Composer notes
October 4, 2014ianchanning	

This is for installing the main packages that Netbeans suggests in the Tools > Options > PHP (tab)

I’m running the following setup currently [21st April 2015]:

    Windows 8.1 (64-bit)
    Netbeans 8.0.2
    The version of Composer doesn’t really matter
    PHP 5.3.28 (It’s sooo last decade, I know…)

tldr;

Just the commands:
1
2
3
4
5
	
composer global require "phpunit/phpunit=4.6.*"
composer global require "phpunit/phpunit-skeleton-generator=*"
composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"
composer global require "phpmd/phpmd=@stable"
composer global require apigen/apigen:~2.8

Then the files to call are in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\
Global packages

running composer global installs the packages into %APPDATA%\Composer (or ~/.composer/ in Linux)
PHPUnit

From the installation instructions (https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html) do:

composer global require "phpunit/phpunit=4.6.*"

This installs PHPUnit to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\phpunit and puts the binary to use in Netbeans in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit.bat

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Frameworks & Tools (tab) > PHPUnit section.
Skeleton Generator

From the installation instructions (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-skeleton-generator) run:

composer global require "phpunit/phpunit-skeleton-generator=*"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit-skelgen.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Frameworks & Tools (tab) > PHPUnit section.
PHP_CodeSniffer

composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpcs.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > Code Sniffer section.
Mess Detector

composer global require "phpmd/phpmd=@stable"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpmd.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > Mess Detector section.
apigen

composer global require apigen/apigen:~2.8

For me this failed see apigen issue #316. The answer to that was to use ~4.0, but that requires PHP >= 5.4

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\apigen.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > ApiGen section.
