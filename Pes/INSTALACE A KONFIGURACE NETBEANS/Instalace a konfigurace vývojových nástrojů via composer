running composer global installs the packages into %APPDATA%\Composer (or ~/.composer/ in Linux)

Just the commands:
	
composer global require "phpunit/phpunit=^6.4"
composer global require "phpunit/phpunit-skeleton-generator=*"
composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"
composer global require "phpmd/phpmd=@stable"
composer global require apigen/apigen:~2.8

Then the files to call are in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\
Global packages


PHPUnit

From the installation instructions (https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html) do:

composer global require "phpunit/phpunit=6.4"

This installs PHPUnit to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\phpunit and puts the binary to use in Netbeans in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit.bat

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Frameworks & Tools (tab) > PHPUnit section.
Skeleton Generator

From the installation instructions (https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-skeleton-generator) run:

composer global require "phpunit/phpunit-skeleton-generator=*"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpunit-skelgen.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Frameworks & Tools (tab) > PHPUnit section.
PHP_CodeSniffer

composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpcs.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > Code Sniffer section.
Mess Detector

composer global require "phpmd/phpmd=@stable"

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\phpmd.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > Mess Detector section.
apigen

composer global require apigen/apigen:~2.8

For me this failed see apigen issue #316. The answer to that was to use ~4.0, but that requires PHP >= 5.4

Then put C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin\apigen.bat into Netbeans Tools > Options > PHP (tab) > Code Analysis (tab) > ApiGen section.
